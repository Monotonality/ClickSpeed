# Terrible Click Speed Test ðŸŽ¯

A frustratingly fun web app that measures your click speed while making it as difficult as possible to click the button!

## Features

- **Moving Button**: The button moves around randomly every 2-5 seconds
- **Mouse Avoidance**: Sometimes the button runs away from your mouse cursor
- **Size Changes**: The button randomly changes size to make clicking harder
- **Real-time Stats**: Track your clicks, clicks per second (CPS), and time
- **Terrible Effects**: Annoying messages, sound effects, and visual feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Click the "CLICK HERE!" button to begin
2. **Click the Button**: Try to click the moving button as many times as possible within 5 seconds
3. **Track Your Progress**: Watch your CPS (clicks per second) in real-time
4. **Restart**: Double-click the button to start a new game

## Why It's "Terrible"

- The button moves around randomly
- It sometimes runs away from your mouse
- Random size changes make targeting difficult
- Annoying messages taunt you
- Sound effects (if your browser supports them)
- The button glows and bounces

## Files

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `styles.css` - Terrible styling and animations
- `script.js` - Game logic and button movement
- `README.md` - This file

## How to Run

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No server required!

## Browser Compatibility

Works best in modern browsers that support:
- CSS animations and transforms
- ES6 classes
- Web Audio API (for sound effects)

## Tips for High Scores

- Use a mouse with high DPI
- Practice your reflexes
- Don't get frustrated (easier said than done!)
- Try to predict where the button might move next

## Technical Details

The app uses:
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 classes)
- CSS animations and transforms
- HTML5 Canvas-like positioning
- Web Audio API for sound effects
- Responsive design principles

Enjoy the frustration! ðŸ˜ˆ
